		I created this website to share the books that I have used throughout my acedemic career at Prairie State College. For many students at PSC (including myself), paying for books was a bit overwhelming. I'd pay out of pocket for an expensive book that I would rarely ever use throughout the semester. Also, let's not forget that PSC is located in a low-income area and a good portion of the student-body can't afford paying out of pocket for certain books (especially Math/Science books). Therefore, enjoy these free eBooks and share this website with your peers. Some professors want you to bring your book to class, so it might be a good idea to invest in a tablet/iPad. Make sure to follow up with your professors prior to bringing your device to class.
